# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using XGBoost and LightGBM.


## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Handling imbalanced data using SMOTE-Tomek.
- Building a stacked model (XGBoost + LightGBM).
- Evaluating the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Explaining the modelâ€™s predictions using SHAP.

## Results
- Precision: 0.99
- Recall: 0.99
- F1-Score: 0.99
- ROC-AUC: 0.998
